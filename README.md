# JavaExercise11.1GeometricObject

The goal of this exercise was to design a class called triangle that extends the geometric object class and overrides getArea, getPerimeter, and toString
so it matches the specifications for the output of a triangle.

Make sure GeometricObject.java, Triangle.java, and GeometricTriangle.java are in the same repository, and then run GeometricTriangle.
